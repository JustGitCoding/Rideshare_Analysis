# Rideshare_Analysis
## Purpose:
Analyzing rideshare data and producing visualizations
## Overview:
### Purpose:
The goal of this analysis is to compare various metrics around ridesharing profitability, usage frequency, and availability at various types of cities (Urban, Suburuban, and Rural). We were particularly interested in the fares (revenues) generated in the first four months of the year. By pivoting our data by 'week', we hope to identify any trends hidden in any of the city types.

## Results:

### Rural
We see that Rural cities have lower demand for rideshares, resulting in lower 'total' fares, fewer drivers (due to lower demand). Due to the low driver count however, we see that individual rides appear to be more expensive (approx $35 on average), likely due to higher demand. Drivers are also generating higher fares (approx $55 on average) compared to those in Suburban and Urban cities, as each driver is receiving a larger proportionate share of the demand for rides.
### Suburban

### Urban
We see that Urban cities have the highest demand for rideshares, resulting in the highest 'total' fares (approx $40K), and highest driver count (in order to meet the high demand). Due to the high driver count however, we see that individual rides appear to be the cheapest in Urban settings (approx $25 on average), likely due to high competition (large supply pool). Drivers are also generating lower fares (approx $17 on average) compared to those in Rural and Suburban cities, as each driver is receiving a smaller proportionate share of the demand for rides.
